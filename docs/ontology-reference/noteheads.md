Represents a note that has 4 beats of duration. Has no stem. In typeset music notation, the glyph differs slightly from `noteheadHalf`, so two distinct class names are used. In handwritten music notation, there is no visual difference between the two.

ðŸŽ¯ **Goal:** Pixels inside the glyph SHOULD NOT be part of the mask. In practise, they sometimes are (disclaimer - the example is a half note):

ðŸŽ¯ **Goal:** Pixels of the ledger line crossing the symbol SHOULD NOT be part of the mask. In practise, they sometimes are:

ðŸ¤– **Validation rules:**

- `noteheadWhole` should have no links to `stem`.


## `noteheadHalf`

<img src="noteheads/noteheadHalf_omniomr-1d507bc2-id871.png" height="100" />

Represents a note that has 2 beats of duration. Has a stem. Can have two stems if it belongs to two voices. In typeset music notation, the glyph differs slightly from `noteheadWhole`, so two distinct class names are used. In handwritten music notation, there is no visual difference between the two.

This class has the same ðŸŽ¯ **Goals** as `noteheadWhole`.

ðŸ¤– **Validation rules:**

- `noteheadHalf` must have at least one link to a `stem` (can have two).


## `noteheadBlack`

<img src="noteheads/noteheadBlack_omniomr-1d507bc2-id96.png" height="100" />

Represents a note that has 1 beat and less of duration. Has a stem, optionally flags or beams. Can have two stems if it belongs to two voices.

ðŸ¤– **Validation rules:**

- `noteheadBlack` must have at least one link to a `stem` (can have two).


## `noteheadFull`

ðŸª¦ **Deprecated:** Use `noteheadBlack` instead.

Used in MUSCIMA++ 2.0, does not align with SMuFL. Treat it as an alias for `noteheadBlack` when parsing MuNG. For new data, use the `noteheadBlack` class instead. Has the exact same definition as the `noteheadBlack` class.

ðŸ¤– **Validation rules:**

- `noteheadFull` should be replaced with `noteheadBlack`.


## `notehead-full`

ðŸª¦ **Deprecated:** Use `noteheadBlack` instead.

Used in MUSCIMA++ 1.0. Now replaced by the `noteheadBlack` class name, which aligns with SMuFL.

ðŸ¤– **Validation rules:**

- `notehead-full` should be replaced with `noteheadBlack`.


## `notehead-empty`

ðŸª¦ **Deprecated:** Use `noteheadWhole` or `noteheadHalf` instead.

Used in MUSCIMA++ 1.0. Now replaced by `noteheadWhole` for whole notes (no stem) or by `noteheadHalf` for half notes (has a stem).

ðŸ¤– **Validation rules:**

- `notehead-empty` should be replaced with `noteheadWhole` if it has no stem and with `noteheadHalf` otherwise.
