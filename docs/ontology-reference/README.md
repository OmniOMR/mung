# Ontology Reference

This is an overview of all MuNG node classes, their meaning, and related links. The reference is split up into groups of related classes, inspired by the [grouping of SMuFL](https://w3c.github.io/smufl/latest/tables/index.html). I started developing this grouping in the [`classNameToUnicode.ts`](https://github.com/OmniOMR/mung-studio/blob/main/src/mung/classNameToUnicode.ts) file in MuNG Studio.
